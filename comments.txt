step 6 involves adding comments to articles

- DB for comments
- Ref to the user and post
- Belong to post class
- post has many comments
- user has many posts
- user has many comments

- need to look at setting up more routes for comments and also generate controller + views

resources :post do
  resources :comments
end
this will produce urls like /post/:id/comments/:id

Do we want a new form for posting comments? or re use the post form?
Look into how to generate messages for when a comment/post is successfully updated / deleted
